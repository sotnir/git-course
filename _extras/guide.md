# Learning Git basics
Based on [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git) here is a list of the basics covering how Git works: 
- 1 Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
- 2 Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
- 3 Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
- 4 "Push" your changes to your main branch
- 5 Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
- 6 "Pull" the changes to your local machine
- 7 Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
- 8 Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
- 9 "Merge" your branch to the main branch
